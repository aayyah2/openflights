Final Project: OpenFlights Shortest Path and Landmark Path


**Description:**
Our final project for CS 225 utilizes an airports dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports.dat) to calculate the most efficient path based on different user preferences. 

1) Most efficient path (with geographic distance travelled as the metric for efficiency) - Dijsktra's Algorithm
2) Landmark path (selecting most efficient path that passes through the given landmarks)
3) BFS Traversal of Graph Nodes

We take in the user's input (starting airport, ending airport, and any landmarks) using std::cin
Ex: To enter ORD, type ORD (no quotes) when prompted. 

The inclusion of a landmark/layover in the itinerary is dictated by the user's input. Enter 0 when prompted for a path with no landmark/layover, and 1 for a path with a layover. You will then be prompted to enter which Landmark Airport you would like to include in the itinerary. 

The complete path is printed out when the calculations are complete. This is formatted with the starting and ending airport printed, along with a step-by-step travel plan and total Km travelled. 


**Example:**

*User Input*

Enter Departure Airport Code: CMI

Enter Arrival Airport Code: FRA

If you want to integrate a layover into your itinerary, enter 1; else enter 0: 1

Please enter the code of your layover: DXB


*Terminal Output*

Starting airport is: CMI

Layover airport is: DXB

Ending airport is: FRA

This is how you get from CMI to FRA via DXB:

Travel to ORD

Travel to ARN

Travel to DXB

Travel to VIE

Travel to NUE

Travel to FRA

Arrived at Destination. Total travelled kilometers are: 16698 Km


**To Build:**
This project is written in C++.
In order to "make", open the main directory on your terminal and run:

1) make
2) ./final

You will then be prompted to enter your inputs and landmarks. 

If you're curious about our testing process and want to see our test cases in action, run:

1) make test
2) ./test


**Usage:**
We think this is a cool representation of what can be done with graph data structures and traversals. Though this is historical data (and therefore not up to date), it's useful to illustrate the complexities of air travel and how algorithms like Dijkstra can be used to quickly and efficiently calculate paths.
