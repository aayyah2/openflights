Week 1:
This week, we worked on setting up the git repository remotely on each of our local workspaces. We also worked on creating the project structure and creating all the files needed for the project. We made a Makefile, “main” class, “BFS” class, and “other” class for necessary functions that didn’t belong in the main or BFS classes. We also committed a sample test and README file. We worked on importing the Airport data into our project and created a dataset parsing function. As a testpoint, we checked main’s functionality, compilation, and importation of the data, and the results were successful. We also checked to make sure that each line of the Airport data was being stored into its own vector. We then declared variables and worked on functions for the store needed attributes latitude, longitude, and airport code. We checked to make sure that the dataset is being read and processed properly, by checking to see that we were able to print any line of data or any specific data we wanted based on latitude, longitude, and airport code.

Week 2:
This week, we worked on the main component of the project which is to find the shortest paths between two particular airports, taking into consider "layovers" due to there not being direct paths from one airport to another at all times. The two algorithms that used were Djikstra and Belman-Ford. In addition to the classes that we had previously, we added a "graph" class to store our graphs that we create with the edges(calculated distance/weight) and vertexes (airport codes). Additionally, we added an "edge" class, a "Djikstra" class and"LandmarkPath" class. Now, our code can traverse through the airport data and find the shortest path between two given airports as well as work through to find an "itinerary" of aiports to go through with any inputted landmark park. We will now be working on getting the BFS traversal to work and making more test cases in order to test our program as well as work on the presentation and report aspect of this Final Project.
