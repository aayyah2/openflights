Week 1:
This week, we worked on setting up the git repository remotely on each of our local workspaces. We also worked on creating the project structure and creating all the files needed for the project. We made a Makefile, “main” class, “BFS” class, and “other” class for necessary functions that didn’t belong in the main or BFS classes. We also committed a sample test and README file. We worked on importing the Airport data into our project and created a dataset parsing function. As a testpoint, we checked main’s functionality, compilation, and importation of the data, and the results were successful. We also checked to make sure that each line of the Airport data was being stored into its own vector. We then declared variables and worked on functions for the store needed attributes latitude, longitude, and airport code. We checked to make sure that the dataset is being read and processed properly, by checking to see that we were able to print any line of data or any specific data we wanted based on latitude, longitude, and airport code.
